Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":142,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["meta"]},{"short_id":"0q8v2t","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0q8v2t","created_at":"2022-12-23T06:57:15.000-06:00","title":"Happy Holidays, Crustaceans","url":"","score":56,"flags":1,"comment_count":16,"description":"\u003cp\u003eEnjoy your time off.\nI wish you all a good time and hope you’ll find a few moments to rest, enjoy and reflect. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S: A bit earlier this year, as apparently some people already got the Friday off?

If these posts are indeed off-topic, should they be removed? If they are on-topic, should a new tag (`social-media`) be added? Given that a large amount of users are flagging these stories, there is a strong case for wanting to filter them out. A disclaimer would probably need to be added (similar to `merkle-trees`), stating something along the lines of non-technical discussions on social media or general business news of social media is not allowed.\r\n\r\nI double-checked the [about page](https://lobste.rs/about), and although many things are explicitly off-topic, social media is not mentioned:  \r\n\u003e entrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, \"I wanted to see what this site's amazing users think about this off-topic thing\", and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can't even settle tabs vs. spaces.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wxrsqk/is_social_media_off_topic","submitter_user":{"username":"cafebeef","created_at":"2022-07-21T22:32:01.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":152,"avatar_url":"/avatars/cafebeef-100.png","invited_by_user":"cocoafleck"},"tags":["ask","meta"]},{"short_id":"tdfoqh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tdfoqh","created_at":"2022-07-22T12:06:59.000-05:00","title":"Ranking comments by sum of replies' scores","url":"","score":18,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"\u003cp\u003eThere are often cases where comments with a poor score (say, 1 point), invite high-quality replies that receive many upvotes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese threads are not shown at the top of the story’s comments page because their “root comment” has a low score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example, as of 2022-07-22 17:00 UTC, is \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/ekvqcf/random_wallpaper_with_just_bash_systemd#c_vop9bt\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/ekvqcf/random_wallpaper_with_just_bash_systemd#c_vop9bt\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe root comment has 1 point,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe first reply has 12 points,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand, in total, 18 points have been accumulated by all the replies with score \u0026gt; 1 point.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the root comment has only 1 point, it remains at the bottom of the page, bringing down with itself also the good comment with 12 points and all the other upvoted comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould an alternative ranking system be put in place, where the threads and subthreads are not sorted by the score of their root comment, but by the \u003cem\u003esum of all the scores of their children\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Maybe taking into account only children with  \u003ccode\u003e\u0026gt;1\u003c/code\u003e point, to avoid giving importance to superficial back-and-forth discussions.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"There are often cases where comments with a poor score (say, 1 point), invite high-quality replies that receive many upvotes.\r\n\r\nThese threads are not shown at the top of the story's comments page because their \"root comment\" has a low score.\r\n\r\nAn example, as of 2022-07-22 17:00 UTC, is \u003chttps://lobste.rs/s/ekvqcf/random_wallpaper_with_just_bash_systemd#c_vop9bt\u003e:\r\n* the root comment has 1 point,\r\n* the first reply has 12 points,\r\n* and, in total, 18 points have been accumulated by all the replies with score \u003e 1 point.\r\n\r\nBecause the root comment has only 1 point, it remains at the bottom of the page, bringing down with itself also the good comment with 12 points and all the other upvoted comments.\r\n\r\nCould an alternative ranking system be put in place, where the threads and subthreads are not sorted by the score of their root comment, but by the _sum of all the scores of their children_?\r\n\r\n(Maybe taking into account only children with  `\u003e1` point, to avoid giving importance to superficial back-and-forth discussions.)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tdfoqh/ranking_comments_by_sum_replies_scores","submitter_user":{"username":"gioele","created_at":"2018-04-25T11:31:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://gioele.io","is_moderator":false,"karma":636,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gioele-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["meta"]},{"short_id":"xf0h8j","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xf0h8j","created_at":"2022-05-28T02:47:43.000-05:00","title":"Tag suggestion: `sqlite`","url":"","score":56,"flags":0,"comment_count":18,"description":"\u003cp\u003eFree-text search for \u003ccode\u003esqlite\u003c/code\u003e reveals nearly 1,000 entries.
